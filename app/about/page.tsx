            <p className="text-center">SpotLock was born out of a simple but powerful realization: 
                managing passwords shouldnt be frustrating or insecure. 
                Our founders spent years juggling countless passwords across pictures, 
                text messages, and sticky notesâ€”always struggling to remember. 
                They knew there had to be a better way.</p>
